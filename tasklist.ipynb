    "- [x] Export the datasets of interest and perform Elementary Data Analysis (EDA)\n",
    "- [x] Design one or more relational databases\n",
    "- [x] **Document the results of data profiling and schema design choices in the final project documentation**\n",

    "### Data Preparation and Integration Part\n",
    "- [x] Consider the relational database(s) designed for the Data Profiling module, including relevant constraints\n",
    "- [x] **Ontology design:** 10+ classes and corresponding object/data properties (now complete)\n",
    "- [x] **Document the ontology and schema using graphical notation** (e.g., UML, ER, or ontology diagram)\n",
    "- [x] **Represent the ontology in Protégé**\n",
    "- [ ] **Design VKG mappings** to connect the ontology to the database using Ontop Plugin for Protégé (or Ontopic Suite)\n",
    "- [ ] **Develop an application** (e.g., in Java or Python) that uses Ontop as a SPARQL endpoint to query the database through the ontology, extracting domain-relevant information\n",

    "### Summary of Current Status\n",
    "- **EDA and Database Design:** Complete\n",
    "- **Ontology:** Complete\n",
    "- **Database Implementation:** Complete\n",
    "- **Documentation:** Missing for application and mappings\n",
    "- **Graphical Representation:** Complete\n",

    "**Next Steps:**\n",
    "1. Document data profiling and schema design choices.\n",
    "2. Create a graphical representation of the ontology.\n",
    "3. Import and refine the ontology in Protégé.\n",
    "4. Design and test VKG mappings in Ontop.\n",
    "5. Develop and test the application with SPARQL queries.\n",
